# FileShare Backend

This is the backend for the FileShare application. It provides three main endpoints for file upload, download, and listing all available files. The files are stored locally on the server without using any database.

## Requirements

Before setting up the backend, ensure that the following requirements are installed on your PC:

- **Node.js** (v12 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)


You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Setup

To set up the backend on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Server

Once the dependencies are installed, start the server by running:

```bash
node server.js
```

The development server should now be running at [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003).
